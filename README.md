===============================

## What is this?
This game is the final project in the 'Classic Arcade Game Clone' unit of [Udacity's Front End Web Developer nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001?v=fe1). It is based on the game Frogger.

## Run the game
To run the game, just clone or download the game from [GitHub](https://github.com/dwds/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game). Then open the 'index.html' file in a web browser!

## Play the game
Press the up, down, left, and right arrow keys to control your character. The goal is to get to the water while avoiding the bugs!

## Who did what?
* [Derek Dadian-Smith](https://github.com/dwds) (that's me) wrote the JavaScript classes and functions to create the functionality of the gameâ€”for example how the enemies and player are positioned, how they move, and what happens when the player runs into stuff. For a complete record of changes made, just check out my [commit history](https://github.com/dwds/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/commits/master).
